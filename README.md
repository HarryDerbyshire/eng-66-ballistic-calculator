<h1>Ballistic Calculator</h1>

<h2>Project Goal</h2>

To create a ballistic calculator which uses firearm and ammunition data from a database which the user can manipulate during runtime. This data will then be represented on a graph that can have key values (gravity etc.) changed during runtime.

<h2>Sprint 1</h2>


<h3>What was achieved</h3>

- Set up repository/board
- [Epic 1: Database Creation](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42578840) was completed fully

<h3>Review</h3>

- Some stories should be written from user perspective

<h3>Retrospective</h3>

<u>What went well?</u>

- Achieved sprint goals
- Manual Tests passed

<u>What to do better?</u>

- Took a long time to understand the Entity Framework with multiple attempts so I should do more preparation/research before coding next time

<h2>Sprint 2</h2>


<h3>What was achieved</h3>

- [Epic 2: CRUD Database Manipulation](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42577734) was completed fully
- [Epic 3: JSON Defaults](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42701739) was completed fully

<h3>Review</h3>

- Start getting work onto a GUI so that I am closer to a MVP

<u>What went well?</u>

- Achieved sprint goals
- Manual Tests passed
- Work was done quickly and effectively
- Research on JSON was done before implementation - making integration easier

<u>What to do better?</u>

- Check off User Story Definition of Done as I go through each story/item when 'In Progress'
- Integrate into a GUI

<h2>Sprint 3</h2>

<h3>What was achieved</h3>

- [Epic 4: GUI - Basic Data Screen](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42704367) was completed fully
- [Epic 5: Calculation Functionality]
