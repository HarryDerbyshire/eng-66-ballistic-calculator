<h1>Ballistic Calculator</h1>

![Name](DatabaseERD.png?raw=true "Title")

To create a ballistic calculator which uses firearm and ammunition data from a database which the user can manipulate during runtime. This data will then be represented on a graph that can have key values (gravity etc.) changed during runtime.

<h2>Sprint 1</h2>


<h3>What was achieved</h3>

- Set up repository/board
- [Epic 1: Database Creation](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42578840) was completed fully

<h3>Review</h3>

- Some stories should be written from user perspective

<h3>Retrospective</h3>

<u>What went well?</u>

- Achieved sprint goals
- Manual Tests passed

<u>What to do better?</u>

- Took a long time to understand the Entity Framework with multiple attempts so I should do more preparation/research before coding next time

<h2>Sprint 2</h2>


<h3>What was achieved</h3>

- [Epic 2: CRUD Database Manipulation](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42577734) was completed fully
- [Epic 3: JSON Defaults](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42701739) was completed fully

<h3>Review</h3>

- Start getting work onto a GUI so that I am closer to a MVP

<u>What went well?</u>

- Achieved sprint goals
- Manual Tests passed
- Work was done quickly and effectively
- Research on JSON was done before implementation - making integration easier

<u>What to do better?</u>

- Check off User Story Definition of Done as I go through each story/item when 'In Progress'
- Integrate into a GUI

<h2>Sprint 3</h2>

<h3>What was achieved</h3>

- [Epic 4: GUI - Basic Data Screen](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42704367) was completed fully
- [Epic 5: Calculation Functionality](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42770300) had these stories completed:
  - [5.1: Cross-Sectional Area](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42770347) was completed fully
  - [5.2: Grain Conversion](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42770417) was completed fully
  - [5.3: Angle Conversion](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42872184) was completed fully

<h3>Review</h3>

- Put more detail into readme file

<u>What went well?</u>

- Achieved most sprint goals
- Manual tests passed
- MVP close to being reached as user can manipulate data with the GUI

<u>What to do better?</u>

- My understanding on how to work WPF is still limited
- Time management did not allow me to finish Epic 5 fully

<h2>Sprint 4<h2>

<h3>What was achieved</h3>

- [Epic 5: Calculation Functionality](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42770300) was completed fully
- [Epic 6: Graphing Capability](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42872360) was completed fully
- [Epic 7: Update Constants in GUI](https://github.com/HarryDerbyshire/eng-66-ballistic-calculator/projects/1#card-42872893) was completed fully
- A general tidy up of the GUI including adding correct headers to the data section for easier readability

<h3>Review</h3>

- UI is lacking in colour/design
- Validation rules not always in place

<u>What went well?</u>

- Achieved sprint goals
- MVP was passed

<u>What to do better?<u>

- Time management: had too many items for the time I allocated for the sprint

<h2>Project Retrospective</h2>

<u>What went well?</u>

- Goals for the project were met and mostly met for the sprint deadlines
- Project has extra functionality than MVP

<u>What to do better?</u>

- Focus slightly more on form rather than function (get the right balance) as currently functionality is good but presentation is lacking
- Considering the limited time available for this project my project scope was quite high and was difficult to do all tasks well so should consider the timeframe more for a project
- The validation in my program is lacking due to me focusing more on implementing more features than securing existing ones. In the future I will balance this more
